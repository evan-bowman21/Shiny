# Shiny

Shiny allows R users to create interactive web models to assist in the exploration of data without relying on knowledge of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

Both the mtcars and mpg app highlight basic examples of interactive visualizations using Shiny. The DC Energy app highlights the ability to conduct univariate and bivariate analysis through visualizations and statistical tests.
